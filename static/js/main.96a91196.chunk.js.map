A winner of over 70 international titles, Reyes was the first player to win world championships in two different disciplines in pool. Among his numerous titles Reyes is a four-time World Eight-ball Champion, the 1999 WPA World Nine-ball Champion, a three-time US Open winner, a two-time World Pool League winner and a 14-time Derby City Classic winner – including an unprecedented five Master of the Table crowns. By defeating Earl Strickland in the inaugural Color of Money event in 1996, Reyes took home the largest single event purse in pool history. Many analysts, fans, and current and former players consider Reyes to be the greatest pool player of all time.',\r\n      'Gambling from a young age, Reyes played three cushion billiards in the 1960s and 1970s. After establishing himself as a winner, he was discovered by promoters. This gave him the opportunity to compete in big-time tournaments.',\r\n      `Numerous fellow professional players have credited Reyes with being the greatest living player in the world. During ESPN television commentary on a semi-finals match between Reyes and Mika Immonen at the 2000 Billiard Congress of America Open 9-Ball Championship, veteran professional Billy Incardona stated that Reyes was \"indisputably the best player in the world—especially when you consider all games—he can play any game as well as anyone, maybe better than anyone....

Since turning professional in 1992, he has won five World Championships, a record seven Masters titles, and a record seven UK Championships, setting a record total of 19 titles in Triple Crown tournaments. He shares the record for the most ranking titles (36) with Stephen Hendry. He is the youngest ever winner of a ranking title winning the 1993 UK Championship aged 17 years and 358 days old. He is also the youngest winner of The Masters winning the 1995 tournament at the age of 19 years and 69 days. His career earnings of over £10 million put him in first place on snooker's all-time prize-money list. Winning the Tour Championship on 24 March 2019 made him the sport's current world number one, the fourth time in his career that he has held the top position and the first time he has been number one since May 2010. This is the longest gap between number one spells by any player in history.`,\r\n      `A prolific break-builder, O'Sullivan holds the record for the most century breaks in professional competition, and is the only player ever to have achieved 1,000 career centuries. He holds the record for the most officially recognised maximum breaks in professional competition, with 15, and he holds the record for the fastest competitive maximum break, compiled in a time of 5 minutes and 8 seconds at the 1997 World Championship.`,\r\n      `Noted for his unpredictable temperament and his struggles with alcohol, drugs, and depression, O'Sullivan has often been a controversial figure in the sport. He has received many warnings and sanctions from its governing body over his conduct and comments, has repeatedly threatened to retire, took a prolonged break from the sport during the 2012/2013 season, and threatened in late 2018 to form a breakaway snooker tour. Outside his playing career, he has worked as a pundit for Eurosport's snooker coverage, has written crime novels and autobiographies, and has starred in the miniseries Ronnie O'Sullivan's American Hustle. He was awarded an OBE in the 2016 New Year Honours.`,\r\n    ],\r\n    image: 'https://i.postimg.cc/qBGQNc37/ro-slider.jpg',\r\n    gallery: [\r\n      'https://i.postimg.cc/FzhZPz2m/ro-1.jpg',\r\n      'https://i.postimg.cc/63rcLnbY/ro-2.jpg',\r\n      'https://i.postimg.cc/xTT5Mkv3/ro-3.jpg',\r\n      'https://i.postimg.cc/8cwbxDSv/ro-4.jpg',\r\n      'https://i.postimg.cc/m2XwwbVf/ro-5.png',\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 3,\r\n    title: 'Shane Van Boening',\r\n    desc:\r\n      'The \"South Dakota Kid\" is hearing-impaired and uses a hearing aid, but it has not limited his ability.',\r\n    summary: [\r\n      'Shane Van Boening (born July 14, 1983) is an American professional pool (pocket billiards) player from Rapid City, South Dakota, a former number 1 in the US rankings published by the UPA Tour.',\r\n      'Van Boening is hearing-impaired and uses a hearing aid, but it has not limited his pool ability.

Mosconi held the officially recognized straight pool high run world record of 526 consecutive balls until John Schmidt broke it in 2019.`,\r\n      `Mosconi retired from tournament play in 1966 but remained active in promoting the game. He consulted and appeared in several movies dealing with billiards, made game show appearances and wrote many articles on billiards, as well as co-authored some books.
