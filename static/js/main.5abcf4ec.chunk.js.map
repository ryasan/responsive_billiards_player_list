He shares the record for the most ranking titles (36) with Stephen Hendry. He is the youngest ever winner of a ranking title winning the 1993 UK Championship aged 17 years and 358 days old. He is also the youngest winner of The Masters winning the 1995 tournament at the age of 19 years and 69 days. His career earnings of over £10 million put him in first place on snooker's all-time prize-money list. Winning the Tour Championship on 24 March 2019 made him the sport's current world number one, the fourth time in his career that he has held the top position and the first time he has been number one since May 2010. This is the longest gap between number one spells by any player in history.`,\n                `A prolific break-builder, O'Sullivan holds the record for the most century breaks in professional competition, and is the only player ever to have achieved 1,000 career centuries. He holds the record for the most officially recognised maximum breaks in professional competition, with 15, and he holds the record for the fastest competitive maximum break, compiled in a time of 5 minutes and 8 seconds at the 1997 World Championship.`,\n                `Noted for his unpredictable temperament and his struggles with alcohol, drugs, and depression, O'Sullivan has often been a controversial figure in the sport. He has received many warnings and sanctions from its governing body over his conduct and comments, has repeatedly threatened to retire, took a prolonged break from the sport during the 2012/2013 season, and threatened in late 2018 to form a breakaway snooker tour. Outside his playing career, he has worked as a pundit for Eurosport's snooker coverage, has written crime novels and autobiographies, and has starred in the miniseries Ronnie O'Sullivan's American Hustle.

Mosconi held the officially recognized straight pool high run world record of 526 consecutive balls until John Schmidt broke it in 2019.`,\n                `Mosconi retired from tournament play in 1966 but remained active in promoting the game. He consulted and appeared in several movies dealing with billiards, made game show appearances and wrote many articles on billiards, as well as co-authored some books. A feud with pool hustler Rudolf \"Minnesota Fats\" Wanderone (concocted mainly by Wanderone himself) kept Mosconi in the spotlight well into the 1970s and 1980s.`\n            ],\n            image: 'https://i.postimg.cc/NfzMDVHP/willie-mosconi-slider.jpg',\n            gallery: [\n                'https://i.postimg.cc/SK0KFMV6/wm-1.jpg',\n                'https://i.postimg.cc/nVTMjMcx/wm-2.jpg',\n                'https://i.postimg.cc/Wb3zMjhk/wm-4.jpg',\n                'https://i.postimg.cc/dVZ0xBRQ/wm-5.jpg',\n                'https://i.postimg.cc/mkdr0p6k/wm-3.jpg'\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n]\n\n\nexport default items\n","import React, { useState, useEffect, createRef } from 'react'\nimport { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom'\n\nimport _items from '../data'\n\nconst CarouselSlideItem = ({ item }) => (\n    <li className='carousel__slide-item' style={item.styles}>\n        <NavLink\n            to={{\n                pathname: '/details',\n                search: `?player=${item.player.title}`,\n                state: item\n            }}\n            className='carousel__slide-item-img-link'>\n            <img src={item.player.image} />\n        </NavLink>\n        <div className='carousel-slide-item__body'>\n            <h4>{item.player.title}</h4>\n            <p>{item.player.desc}</p>\n        </div>\n    </li>\n)\n\nconst cycle = ['0', '30rem', '60rem', '90rem', '120rem']\n\nconst Carousel = () => {\n    const [items, setItems] = useState(_items)\n    const [step, setStep] = useState(0)\n    const [isTicking, setIsTicking] = useState(false)\n\n    const handleLeftClick = () => {\n        if (!isTicking) {\n            setIsTicking(true)\n            setStep(prev => (prev + 1 + items.length) % 5)\n            setItems(items =>\n                items.map((item, i) => {\n                    const xPos = (i + step + 1) % 5\n                    return {\n                        ...item,\n                        styles: {\n                            transform: `translateX(${cycle[xPos]})`,\n                            opacity: xPos === 0 || xPos === 4 ? 0 : 1,\n                            filter: xPos === 1 || xPos === 3 ?
